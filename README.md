# Noted

## Motivation
If you search for a guitar note trainer on Google, the first result is the one by GuitarOrb.com. It's great, but it lacks some important features!
Why can't I use a custom tuning? Why does it only let me identify the note of a given position on the fretboard, instead of letting me also locate a given note? 
The other popular guitar note trainers lack these features too, so I made *Noted*!

*Noted* fills the aforementioned gaps in the other trainers, giving you a more complete fretboard trainer so you can master your fretboard faster, no matter what it is!

## Quick Start
If you have VS Code, then open the project and run with Live Server.

## Usage
- **Custom Tuning**: You can use your own tuning, no matter how out there it may be!
- **Locate Mode**: The other guitar note trainers only give you a position on the fretboard and asks you what note it is. 
With *Noted*, you can do this in Identify Mode, and also go into Locate Mode so that you are given a note and then asked to locate it on the fretboard.
You can further adjust the settings so that you can locate **all** of the note's locations.
- **Specify Range**: Besides working with the whole fretboard, you can specify a range of strings and frets. 
If you're a total beginner with a standard six string, I recommend learning the notes on all strings, from frets 0-5. 
If you started learning barre chords, do all the frets on string 6 and 5.
